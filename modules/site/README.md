# site module

This is for generic resources related to this install. To quote the [Puppet blog](http://puppetlabs.com/blog/testing-puppet-code-in-the-puppet-playground) on this one:

> If you need to provide custom files, the sanest approach is to place them in
> the templates directory of a custom "site" module (call it 'site' or however
> you want) and refer to it using the content parameter.
